              At this stage my long term goal to become a more rounded Human Skills Facilitator is still my goal but I can see that the only limitations to doing something else with these new found skills is myself. I want to be able to offer my services or knowledge to others especially for my whƒÅnau in the Far North.

            <h3><strong>Strengths & Limitations</strong></h3>
            <p>
              To be fair these haven't changed much as there is still lots I want to work on and get better at like being better at managing a team and other things that I will enjoy like team work and collaborating. Also I like joking around lots, NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY! just like having a laugh while I work and hopefully I can find that throughout Bootcamp.

            <h2><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></h2>
            <div class="column">
              <p>
                Not sure if this has anything to do with Bootcamp but maybe waking up for work the next day as I can imagine there will be lots of work being done in the evenings due to the nature of the PTBC. It should be ok, I will just need to keep clear comms with my work colleagues if anything does come up for me during PTBC.

            <h2><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></h2>

                I'm not sure to be honest! I feel like I have learnt a lot about Human Skills throughout my journey as a facilitator and learn new things every cohort. I guess for me it will be more about putting these skills into action and using everything I have learned to be able to work with others and communicate clearly to my facilitator.

                I have no expectations from the team. As I mentioned in my Learning Plan as I know they are the best at what they do.
