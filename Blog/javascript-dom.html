            <p>Let me begin by sharing a story I wrote for my Sprint-2 reflection, this is my take on the relationship between html & CSS,</p>
            <p><em>There were these two cuzzies, Henry and Chief. Henry was a very structured and logical person while his cuzzy Chief was a pretty creative and haututu fulla. They spent heaps of time together and enjoyed building cool things.
            One weekend Henry went to stay over at Chiefs place. They wanted to hire a game to play on Chiefs N64, so off they went to Video Ezy. Henry was searching the shelves and spotted this game called Tetris, he checked the back of the cover and immediately liked how the blocks fit together to build structures. 'Chief look at this!' Chief was like 'wooooah! cool cuz, I like the colours and shapes heaps!' he told Henry.</em></p>
            <p><em>While they were playing the game, Henry really enjoyed making basic shapes and patterns similar to the structure of html which uses simple tags to create the structure of a web page.
            Chief was more interested in the game's colours and style. He really liked how the blocks could make cool colours and be changed to make cool patterns like CSS which adds, colour, font and style to html pages to look cool
            Henry and Chief continued playing Tetris making heaps of cool, colourful patterns, remembering all the cool things they were able to create. Just like Web Development, html and CSS need to work together like Henry and Chief, to create awesome, eye-catching web pages.
            By reading this story I want to talk about the new relationship with their other cuzzy.</em></p>
            <p>Intro JavaScript or Jimmy.
            Who is Jimmy? Jimmy is the cousin with all the flash gears, who always tends to look down at his cousins. Jimmy is the one who always has to have his way. He often tells Henry that his clothes look old and tatty, that he should be wearing things like Jimmy does and to get rid of his old looking clothes because Jimmy’s clothes look better. Jimmy always eavesdrops on Henry and Chiefs convos, usually always complaining because he wants to change Chiefs ideas ‘How rude, Right! But Chief knows better than Jimmy most times. Jimmy is too cool for Video Ezy, he’d rather just download stuff off the internet because he’s too impatient and doesn’t want to wait for Henry to decide. Jimmy would rather change things without asking his cousins.</p>
            <p>Just like Jimmy, Java Script can interact with html components directly. JS can access and manipulate the content, attributes, and properties of HTML elements. JavaScript is commonly used to handle user interactions and respond to events that occur within the HTML elements. It can listen for various events, such as clicks, mouse movement, key pressing, form submissions, and more. JS can access and update CSS properties and classes to change the appearance and behavior of elements but we must remember that CSS is responsible for styling and presentation. JavaScript can also receive data from a server and update the HTML structure or apply the received data to specific HTML elements. This enables real-time updates, data-driven web applications, and more.</p>
