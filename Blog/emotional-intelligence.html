              According to the VeryWellMind website<q cite=”https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-emotional-intelligence-2795423”>Emotional intelligence or EQ is the ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use emotions to communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively. It shares that the ability to express and control emotions is essential, but so is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to the emotions of others. Some experts suggest that emotional intelligence is more important than IQ for success in life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
              Researchers suggest that there are four different levels of emotional intelligence including emotional perception, the ability to reason using emotions, the ability to understand emotions, and the ability to manage emotions,
            </p>
              <h3><strong>Perceiving emotions:</strong></h3>
              <p>
                    The first step in understanding emotions is to perceive them accurately. In many cases, this might involve understanding nonverbal signals such as body language and facial expressions.
            </p>
              <h3><strong>Reasoning with emotions:</strong></h3>
              <p>
                This step involves using emotions to promote thinking and cognitive activity. Emotions help prioritize what we pay attention and react to; we respond emotionally to things that garner our attention.
            </p>
              <h3><strong>Understanding emotions:</strong></h3>
              <p>
                The emotions that we perceive can carry a wide variety of meanings. If someone is expressing angry emotions, the observer must interpret the cause of the person's anger and what it could mean. For example, if your boss is acting angry, it might mean that they are dissatisfied with your work, or it could be because they got a speeding ticket on their way to work that morning or that they've been fighting with their partner.
            </p>
              <h3><strong>Managing emotions:</strong></h3>
              <p>
                The ability to manage emotions effectively is a crucial part of emotional intelligence and the highest level. Regulating emotions and responding appropriately as well as responding to the emotions of others are all important aspects of emotional management.

          <h2><strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong></h2>
          <div class="column">
            <p>
              IQ measures the ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ measures the ability to recognise emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2><strong>Why is EQ important?</strong></h2>
          <div class="column">
            <p>
              Success in life is influenced by many things. Two important factors are IQ and EQ. Health, well-being, and happiness also contribute to overall success. Instead of debating which factor is more important, it's beneficial to develop skills in multiple areas. This means not only enhancing cognitive abilities like memory and focus but also acquiring and improving social and emotional skills. By focusing on various aspects, you increase your chances of achieving success and leading a fulfilling life, but! EQ is important because it helps us understand and manage our own emotions, empathize with others, and build strong relationships. It enhances our personal and professional interactions, leading to better decision-making, effective communication, and overall well-being.
