              This one time during foundations I was stuck on this problem and it was making me soo MAD! There’s these things called variables and sometimes if you don’t define them properly it can cause a little error and your inner critic makes you think that it is HUGE. So I learnt to make sure I read my code properly so everything aligns correctly. It's important to ask for help no matter how small the error because another set of eyes may be able to pick up the little things you can’t see. There has been more than one occasion where I have fixed a lot of little problems that have made me feel like I was the best problem solver ever and all they were, were little typos, Oh man how many times have I had typos during this journey. I don’t know how many times it's been after I have asked for help or committed my code that I have spotted typos. It’s so crazy to think that using the wrong bracket because there are multiple or a semicolon and not a normal colon has held me up. All I can do is sit back and have a laugh. I learnt that it is very important to read your code.</p>

              I find this pic funny because I hate spiders lol</p> 
            <p>
              I feel like reading has become such an important thing now. I don’t enjoy reading, never have but now it’s quite rewarding.</p>
            <p>
              There’s these techniques that I have really been enjoying and some that have made me wonder ‘what the heck is that?’. Pseudocode is just a fancy word for making notes, this thing called the rubber ducky method well that made me wonder heaps lol I had to ask a work mate what it was and all they done was picked up this little toy car that’s been sitting on my desk and said ‘talk to this!’ I know right! I was thinking the same thing. They explained it by saying ‘when you hear yourself saying the problem out loud you can sometimes spot the solution’ I can’t say I have experienced this yet though.</p>
            <p>
              I can’t say I have figured out console.log properly but hopefully it will come to me soon. I think for some people, especially me, I will naturally shy away from asking for help because we have always had this fixed mindset where we think ‘Ahh I don’t need help, I want to lean into this a lot more throughout the rest of this learning journey. I think it has always been hard to ask for help myself you know? Being the oldest sibling I always felt like I needed to just figure things out on my own before looking for help, majority of the time I was able to do it but in this case this is a whole new thing and I must remember that I have no idea what is going on. In time I know this experience will benefit not just me but my whānau and my mahi. Anyway that’s what I’ve been thinking about lately lol especially during our latest sprint and as we get closer to Bootcamp.</p>
