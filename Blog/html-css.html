        <h1>What are the Margin, Padding & Border properties?</h1>

          <h2>Margin</h2>
          <p>The Margin property defines the space around elements or content. This property helps to create seperation between elements. This improves the ability to read web pages and makes each element visually appealing. It is completely transparent and doesn't have any background colour. It clears an area around the element.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2>Padding</h2>
          <p>Unlike the margin property, the padding property provides the space within the element, this allows content to breath and enhances the user experiences. We can independently change the four sides by using separarte properties. These properties are <strong>padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left</strong> & <strong>padding-right</strong> We can also change all properties at the same time by using the shorthand <strong>padding</strong> property.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2>Border</h2>
          <p>The border property is the surrounding space around the content. The border can be used to provide structure and helps define elements. This is the space between the margin and padding properties. The border properties  can be edited using CSS, these are used to specify the style, colour and size of the border element.
          <p>The differnet border properties are shared below:</p>
          <p>- border-style</p>
          <p>- border-colour</p>
          <p>- border-width</p>
          <p>- border-radius</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
