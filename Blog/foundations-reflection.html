              A couple things I learnt about myself are things like, I am more than capable of learning new things, I am able to complete work when it is exciting and interesting with so much support wrapped around me from facilitators colleagues and friends. There is still so much to learn and explore in this ever evolving industry. I believe in the journey of life long learning. I feel that there is still loads to learn.
            </p>

              The role of values I believe is so that you maintain integrity in everything you do. Empathy is important because you can connect with your peers on a similar level, as we are all in some way learning something new. Whether it be core or tech.
            </p>
            <p>
              Something that has surprised me being a facilitator in similar content is that I am still capable of learning more about Human Skills. The values Tika, Pono and Aroha are what I keep in mind in all aspects of my life.
            </p>
            <p> 
              The most challenging part about learning about core is that if you are open to learning more about yourself and how you communicate with others this shouldn’t be a hard concept to lean into and you will benefit more from it, you will definitely learn lots. If you feel that you won’t gain anything from core learning this can mean that you are in a serious state of a closed mindset. Accept that you will always learn something about yourself even if you believe that you won’t. Even though I teach core content for mahi I really enjoyed this aspect of Foundations and I am really excited to be a student of Human Skills.

              I feel we spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course is because it is an important part of building good communication skills especially in an industry that has been such a solo-silo type of work in the past. Core will only build on better team work skills, collaboration and a more exciting and fun kind of work,
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that learning core is an important part of any learning environment and should be practiced more. I am lucky that I was taught these skills from a young age without knowing that it would become this important in life. I was fortunate enough to learn these skills as the eldest sibling during a life changing event such as losing a parent but I learnt a lot and continue to learn.
