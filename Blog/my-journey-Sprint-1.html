              To be honest I started a week early, I knew I was going to have a busy week with mahi so I thought I’d get a head start. The week leading up to the 24th I was just in preparation mode, making sure my laptop was all set-up for the work ahead. During that week, final week of Boot camp for our in campus students. This is generally one of the busier weeks as we prepare for student showcase and try finish of marking students assessments. This time there were looooads of students yet to complete work. It’s ok tho, we manage to get everyone through. 
              Day of the showcase is usually long, prep the space, students prep themselves for their presentations to family and friends and speeches. What a drag. Overall it was a good evening. 
              Next day could sleep in a bit as I was heading to Gisborne with Caro and Dougal to meet Kane and Renee at the Tairāwhiti start up weekend event, each evening when we return to our motel I’d spend a couple hours doing Sprint-1 work. Run it past Dougal to see if it’s good. 
              Monday first day of PTBC and I was already well prepared. I’d finished most of my reflections and created my html file to begin my blog. I had to slow down a bit as there were tasks that needed the help of my fellow Pikopiko whānau. 
              Caught up with Lani and John, they are our facilitators, Lani had asked to wait until atleast Friday to make a pull-request as my mates were still in set-up mode. We had our first home group hui on the 26th, I was meant to be in Wellington but had missed my flight. My fault I didn’t grab my guitar the day before. 
              Anyway, it’s been a good week, half way through Sprint-2 just messing around with CSS a bit too much I think. I’m gonna look in to that log in Sarah from Harakeke cohort sent me and try practice some JavaScript. 
              Log off.
