          <h2><em>Week 1 - 24 April - 30 April 2023</em></h2>
            <p>To be honest I started a week early, I knew I was going to have a busy week with mahi so I thought I’d get a head start. The week leading up to the 24th I was just in preparation mode, making sure my laptop was all set-up for the work ahead. During that week, final week of Boot camp for our in campus students. This is generally one of the busier weeks as we prepare for student showcase and try finish of marking students assessments. This time there were looooads of students yet to complete work. It’s ok tho, we manage to get everyone through. 
            Day of the showcase is usually long, prep the space, students prep themselves for their presentations to family and friends and speeches. What a drag. Overall it was a good evening. 
            Next day could sleep in a bit as I was heading to Gisborne with Caro and Dougal to meet Kane and Renee at the Tairāwhiti start up weekend event, each evening when we return to our motel I’d spend a couple hours doing Sprint-1 work. Run it past Dougal to see if it’s good. 
            Monday first day of PTBC and I was already well prepared. I’d finished most of my reflections and created my html file to begin my blog. I had to slow down a bit as there were tasks that needed the help of my fellow Pikopiko whānau. 
            Caught up with Lani and John, they are our facilitators, Lani had asked to wait until atleast Friday to make a pull-request as my mates were still in set-up mode. We had our first home group hui on the 26th, I was meant to be in Wellington but had missed my flight. My fault I didn’t grab my guitar the day before. 
            Anyway, it’s been a good week, half way through Sprint-2 just messing around with CSS a bit too much I think. I’m gonna look in to that log in Sarah from Harakeke cohort sent me and try practice some JavaScript.</p>

          <h2><em>Week 2 - 1 May - 7 May 2023</em></h2>
            <p>This week was cool. We’ve had a couple more people join us throughout the week. I’ve been working through Sprint-2 which I should be able to send for marking this week. 
            It’s been good fun working through Sprint-2 activities and completing my reflections. I should finish this by Wednesday at the latest. Getting loads of help from everyone and it’s been pretty cool connecting with the other students and trying to help them out or just talk with them. JG is crack up and homegroups have been cool. It’s sik that things are connecting all goods, I mean concepts. I want to try some stretch material. 
            I’ve been adding extra pages to my home page and everyday I get a little better at reviewing my own code lol it’s crazy learning that Whiti is learning Python at kura I wonder how Ahmad will feel when it let him know. 
            I still want to use Sarah’s log in to practice some JavaScript. The language is getting easier every day.</p>

          <h2><em>Week 3 - 8 May - 14 May 2023</em></h2>
            <p>This week has been a lot of fun and a whole lot of reading, watching YouTube, connecting with facilitators who have been such a massive help with everything. Lani has helped soo much with my code with code reviews and such valuable feedback. In this Sprint the biggest thing that I wanted to work on was making my whole blog responsive. Without the help of Lani I think I would've been hitting my head on my desk or something LOL but even she acknowledge that some of my initial bits of code was given her a sore brain but she was determined. Big week with mahi as well. Had a big staff meeting which I reckon ruffled some feathers and then Auckland was hit with another emergency alert due to heavy rain, Auckland under water again. The next day it was gone, worked from my apartment that day due to staff parking situation, worked on some bits for our students they can do Human Skills reflections easier. Thursday was our first Deep Dive for this cohort which I felt went really well apart from a bit of a hiccup towards the end. I swear the notes were just not making any sense. At the end of the Deep Dive one of the students asked if they could look at my notes and even they said it was confusing, I believe it may have been because that section of the Deep Dive is a bit of dialogue between myself and my ol work mate. Anyway I just winged it and it was sweet. Students went for a walk and talk which I think is a really cool finisher to Depp Dives. Friday was chill, we did Friday check-ins with students after mindfulness and everyone contributed which was sik! Anyway I will ask Lani to check my sprint 2 mahi tomorrow and see what she thinks of the work I have done this weekend.</p>
