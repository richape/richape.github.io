        <p>One evening I needed to purchase some necessities and a couple things to eat. I went to the closest shop I knew would be open at the time, which was BP here in Newmarket, not a cheap place to buy. I brought what I needed and on my way to my car I noticed a Māori man sitting outside to the left of the entrance. He was well dressed and looked around about my age so I asked him if he wanted something to eat. He explained his story to me. He was at the hospital with family and had brought them food and didn’t have enough money to buy his return ticket. He wasn’t allowed to stay at the hospital with his whānau so he wanted to go home. He ran out of time to buy the ticket and he would’ve been short by a few dollars anyway. I gave him the money he needed so that he didn’t have to wait in Auckland until his next pay. He was so thankful.</p>
        <p>I didn’t need the money as I would’ve just brought beers or something else. He was in need of it more than me. I felt like it was the tika (right) thing to do. Looking back now I still feel like it was the right thing to do.</p>

        <h2><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong></h2>
      <br>
        <div class="text">
          <p>There are three basic values in Te Ao Māori or Māori society.</p>
          <p>Tika - Learning to do things that are right for yourself, your whānau or hapū and your community,</p>
          <p>Pono - Doing things with the right intentions. Something learnt from tikanga Māori whether this be tangihanga, whanaungatanga or even mahi, when  you do something that you feel is pono you feel good, feel like you have accomplished something that is right and meaningful,</p>
          <p>Aroha - Doing daily things with aroha is the most positive feeling. You always feel happy when you do things out of aroha. Doesn’t matter if it’s mahi, hui or whatever, aroha trumps everything,</p>
          <p>I feel that these 3 values help me with my mahi, my whānau and friends. I always try to see the positive in everything that happens around me. If I do notice things that I don’t think are aligning with these values I won’t hesitate to question the intentions.</p>
