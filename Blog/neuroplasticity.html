        <h2><strong>Exploring the benefits of understanding neuroplasticity, strategies for engaging with its principles, ways to enhance my own neuroplasticity, and a valuable resource I used for this topic.</strong></h2>

              <p>I did a Google search to find articles on the principles of neuroplasticity and found a good link that shared the ten principles and examples for each relating to people who have been affected by an illness, stroke or something similar where a patient needed rehabilitation. The majority of these examples shared similar approaches to show how important it is to keep training the brain or using the brain to remember such things as learning how to swallow again. Neuroplasticity offers hope and opportunity to individuals to improve their cognitive abilities, motor skills and overall quality of life. These principles demonstrate that consistent and targeted training, repetition, and meaningful engagement can lead to positive changes in the brain and enhance functional abilities.</p> 
              <p>Additionally the potential implications of neuroplasticity in other contexts such as learning new skills like web development or acquiring languages. By adapting these principles we can find that neuroplasticity can benefit individuals in lots of new areas of personal growth and individual development.</p>
              <p>I feel that by using the principles mentioned in the link I can create a plan to develop new skills and learn new languages such as html, CSS, JavaScript and other languages or concepts in the near future. A good plan which will include a lot of repetition, meaningful engagement and overall consistent and targeted training. A good study plan will be beneficial for the brain just as much as a good gym routine is for the body.</p>
              <p>Some ways in which I can increase my neuroplasticity are: Repetition and practice, utilizing the concept of ‘YET’ instead of beating myself up about not understanding something right away. Making use of things I learn and putting things into context by applying what I learn to the world around me. I am hopeful that by practicing these I am able to increase my neuroplasticity and enhance my learning outcomes.</p>
