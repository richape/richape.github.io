        <h2><strong>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <div class="text">
        <p>My long term goal is to become a more rounded Human Skills facilitator, by completing this course I want to be able to offer more than pastoral care for future students but also be able to support them with tech concepts as well.</p>

        <h2><strong>What are my strengths and limitations whin it comes to learning?</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <div class="text">
        <h3><strong>Strengths:</strong></h3>
        <br>
          <p>One of my strengths is being able to connect with others. I feel this is an important skill to have especially as a Human Skills facilitator. This was a strength I had learnt growing up, being around my elders. Being the eldest sibling it was important as my Dad passed away when me and my siblings were younger. This was a something I found helped my younger siblings and my Mum. Connecting with others also contributes to being a good team player. I have always played or worked in large tema environments and learnt some goods skills that I continue to use everyday. Having a good sense of humor I believe is another strength I have, somethimes humor helps ground people. I feel it is important to have during stressful times as it helps create better working relationships and work productivity.</p>
        <h3><strong>Limitations:</strong></h3>
        <br>
          <p>Even though I mentioned being a good team player as one of my strengths I would like to build on the ability to be better at team management. I’ve been fortunate enough to be a part of 6 cohorts at Dev Academy Aotearoa and have watched students grow as good leaders and team managers. This is something I strive to work on during my time as a student. Reading comprehension is a bit of a limitation as it has been for me since I was young. Another limitation I find annoying is starting something and not completing it, I have learnt though that if I have due dates or an end point that this helps with my progress.</p>

        <h2><strong>What skills (non-technical, core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <div class="text">
        <p>I want to develop my team management skills. I feel like my team management skills now are average but this is something I want to build on. Never hurts to excel at something.</p>

        <h2><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <div class="text">
        <p>During work hours I will use my lunch break to check in with my fellow cohort members and look at any work I have due to create a plan of attack to follow for when I get back to my apartment. I feel like this won’t be any trouble as I just watch YouTube all evening. So by doing this it will be a better and productive distraction.</p>
        <p>What will I do when things are building up and starting to get to me?</p>
        <p>It honestly takes a lot before I start feeling like any build up starts affecting the way I approach things. But iif it does come to that point I would need two plans, for instance at work and at my apartment,</p>
        <p>1. At work I would go for a vape or a walk. Probably go find something to eat, that seems to help heaps,</p>
        <p>2. At my apartment I would turn my laptop off and chill out by watching YouTube or having a jam on the good ol PS4. I will even think that going for a drive and listening to some loud jams will help heaps,</p>

      <br>
        <h2><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <div class="text">
        <p>If I become stuck I would review my work and will try to limit the time to 5 - 10 minutes. I will then make contact with my fellow cohort members to see if anyone has potentially come across the same issue. In the case that I am still stuck after this I will do a google search or prompt ChatGPT, something that Ahmad has been teaching me. Using this as a facilitation tool and not to directly look for the answers. I would spend the same amount of time doing this before I seek help from the facilitators.</p>

        <p>I don’t expect too much from the facilitators as I know they are really good at their job.</p>

        <p>9am to 5pm I will be at work but will block out my lunch breaks to look over any work. Due to the nature of PTBC I may go hang out with friends or travel to Awanui to see whānau and friends.</p>
