# Welcome to My blog


On my blog [My blog page](https://richape.github.io/index.html) you can follow my journey as a student at Dev Academy on the part-time programme whilst working as a Human Skills facilitator Full-time.
I have added links to my posts and plan to update it throughout this endeavour of becoming a Web Developer to benefit my role here in the Tāmaki Makaurau campus.
## **Header**


On my blog you will find the header of my page with two dropdown tabs,
1. __Tūāpapa__ - foundations,
2. __Taku haerenga__ - my journey,

When you click on the __Tūāpapa__ - foundations dropdown menu you will have two more options that you can click on to navigate to one of the pages I have worked on during Foundations. These two dropdown menus are,
1. __Hangarau__ - technology,
  - [Margin, Border & Padding](https://richape.github.io/Blog/html-css.html),

The tab **Taku Haerenga** - [my journey](https://richape.github.io/Blog/my-journey-Sprint-1.html) is a weekly journal of my
journey as a student at [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/). 

## **Body**


On the body of my blog page there is a heading __Ko wai koe?__ or who am I?
Followed by a profile photo of myself with a brief introduction in Te Reo Māori. ![a photo of myself](./Photos/profile%20button.JPG)

Under __Ko wai koe?__ I have added two columns with a little kōrero about
who I am and a small snippet of my journey at Dev Academy Aotearoa before becoming
a student on the part-time bootcamp. 

In the next column I shared a little bit about why I want to complete
this study as it will add to my current role as a Human Skills facilitator 
for Dev Academy.

## **Footer**

Currently it is not a footer but at the bottom of my page I have added
three buttons to __Linkedin, GitHub__ & __my work email__

*My blog is a work in progress and I will be making changes throughout my
journey*
