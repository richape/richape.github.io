## **Header**


On my you will find the header of my page with two dropdown tabs,
1. __Tūāpapa__ - foundations,
2. __Taku haerenga__ - my journey,

When you click on the __Tūāpapa__ - foundations dropdown menu you will have two more options that you can click on to navigate to one of the pages I have worked on during Foundations. These two dropdown menus are,
1. __Hangarau__ - technology,
2. __Pokapū__ - core,

## **Body**


On the body of my blog page there is a heading __Ko wai koe?__ or who am I?
Followed by a photo of myself with a brief introduction in Te Reo Māori.

Under __Ko wai koe?__ I have added two columns with a little kōrero about
who I am and a small snippet of my journey at Dev Academy Aotearoa before becoming
a student on the part-time bootcamp. 

In the next column I shared a little bit about why I want to complete
this study as it will add to my current role as a Human Skills facilitator 
for Dev Academy.

## **Footer**

Currently it is not a footer but at the bottom of my page I have added
three buttons to __Linkedin, GitHub__ & __my work email__
